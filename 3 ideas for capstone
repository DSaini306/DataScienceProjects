Idea 1: Analyzing price of the car- Price of a new/used car depends on multiple variables including their miles driven, model, year make. However, does the weather in a city affect the demand of certain types of cars? To answers such questions, I plan to analyze the trend of the car prices with other factors such as the environment to imporive the car price predictions. 
Idea 2: Predicting the deviation in Moore's Law- So far the development in technology has been undergoing by rules of the Moore's Law. The drastic reduction in device sizes demands highly efficient small sized transistors at the scale of nanometers. Despite a huge emphasis on small scaled electronics, nanoscience has been struggling to compete with the Moore's Law. Given the trailing technological advancement, can data science provide us with a modified Moore's Law?
Idea 3: Inflation in next 20 years- Based on the economic data available now, can we predict the inflation in next 20 years to predict what interest rate will be best to take the loan on?
